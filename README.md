Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that is facing competition from online video streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. Management asked that I conduct an analysis on their movies and customer habits to determine a worthwhile strategy for rolling out their own streaming service. Provided with a data set containing information on things such as rental rates, rental durations, customer region, and genre information I managed to conduct an analysis that answered stakeholder questions about customer demographics and the performance of various film genres. In addition to providing recommendations for the production of their streaming service, I also made recommendations regarding the implementation of a customer loyalty program to retain high-spenders.
